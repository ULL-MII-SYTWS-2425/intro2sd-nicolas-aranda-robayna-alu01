# Chapter 2: Lifecycle Types and Their Rationales

**Author:** James Cadle  
**Resource:** Developing Information Systems: Practical Guidance for IT Professionals  

This chapter introduces different **System Development Lifecycles (SDLCs)** and their application. It explores linear and evolutionary approaches, Agile, and hybrid methods, helping to decide the best approach.

## Key Concepts

### What is an SDLC?
An SDLC is a framework guiding the stages of system development, including feasibility study, requirements, design, development, testing, and implementation. These stages ensure structured and efficient system delivery.

### Linear vs. Evolutionary Approaches
- **Linear:** Follows a sequential flow (e.g., Waterfall, V-Model). Best for stable requirements but less adaptable to change.
- **Evolutionary:** Iterative and adaptive (e.g., Spiral, Agile). Ideal for unclear requirements or innovation.

### Lifecycle Examples
1. **Waterfall:** Rigid and step-by-step. Strong for well-defined projects but struggles with changing requirements.
2. **V-Model:** Enhances testing and quality assurance. Suitable for safety-critical systems.
3. **Incremental:** Delivers functionality in parts, allowing earlier customer feedback.
4. **Spiral:** Focuses on risk reduction through iterations and prototypes.
5. **Agile:** Collaborative and iterative. Excellent for fast-changing environments but requires close customer involvement.

## Impact of Agile
Agile revolutionized SDLCs with its focus on collaboration, adaptability, and delivering working software quickly. While effective for small teams, challenges arise in regulated environments or large-scale projects.

## Choosing the Right Approach
Selecting an SDLC depends on factors like:
- **Complexity:** Simple problems suit Waterfall; complex ones may need Spiral or Agile.
- **Team Experience:** Familiarity with the approach often ensures success.
- **Requirements Stability:** Stable requirements favor linear methods; evolving ones need iterative approaches.
- **Customer Involvement:** High involvement from customers fits with Agile; low involvement aligns with linear models.

By tailoring the SDLC to the project's needs, organizations can balance flexibility, quality, and efficiency effectively.
